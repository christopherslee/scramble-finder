# clojure_fu

Given a grid of letters, write a function that determines if a word
exists within that grid. From any letter, you can move north, south,
east, or west (no diagonals), and cannot repeat the letters.


  ```
    Example: "CLOJURE"
    A B E R X
    O C L U R
    M N O J P
    T Y U V W

    # # E R #
    # C L U #
    # # O J #
    # # # # #
  ```

Warning: I'm new to clojure, so I assume this is a very suboptimal
solution.
